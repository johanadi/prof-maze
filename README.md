# prof-maze Project by Johana Di Girolamo
As a freshman in college, this was my final project for my CS1 course - *Completed in Dec. of 2018.*

## How it works:
This program is a series of mini-games that has the storyline of a student attempting to win these games in order to get bonus credit on their final grade from the professor.
The professor is allowing the student to make up to 3 mistakes before the deal is off, so try your best!

## Includes:
- **A maze**
- **CS-related Trivia**
- **Word Un-Scramblers**
- **MasterMind game**
- and the final level, **Figure the Key Phrase**

## Future Ideas:
It would be interesting to see more of the pieces of this project be more dynamic. For instance, having the maze be auto-generated (assuring that there's always a correct path), etc.
